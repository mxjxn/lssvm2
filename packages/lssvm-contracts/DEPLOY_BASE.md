# Base Mainnet Deployment Guide

This guide walks you through deploying your own factory and router contracts to Base Mainnet, reusing sudoswap's stateless bonding curves.

## Prerequisites

1. **Foundry installed**: `forge --version` should work
2. **Base Mainnet RPC**: Get an RPC endpoint (Alchemy, Infura, or public)
3. **Deployment account**: Account with sufficient ETH for gas fees
4. **Environment variables**: Set up in `.env.local` (see below)

## Step 1: Set Up Environment Variables

Create `packages/lssvm-contracts/.env.local` with the following:

```bash
# Network Configuration
RPC_URL=https://mainnet.base.org
# Or use your own RPC endpoint:
# RPC_URL=https://base-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_API_KEY

# Deployment Account
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here

# Contract Verification (optional but recommended)
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_base_scan_api_key_here

# Contract Configuration
# Manifold Royalty Registry for Base Mainnet
# For Base and most EVM chains, use the universal address:
ROYALTY_REGISTRY=0xad2184fb5dbcfc05d8f056542fb25b04fa32a95d

# Address that will receive protocol trading fees
PROTOCOL_FEE_RECIPIENT=0xYourFeeRecipientAddress

# Protocol fee multiplier (in base 1e18)
# Example: 0.01e18 = 1%, 0.05e18 = 5%
# Maximum: 0.1e18 (10%)
PROTOCOL_FEE_MULTIPLIER=10000000000000000

# Address that will own the factory contract
# This address can whitelist bonding curves, routers, and update fees
FACTORY_OWNER=0xYourFactoryOwnerAddress
```

**Important**: Replace all placeholder addresses with your actual addresses.

## Step 2: Deploy Contracts

Run the deployment script:

```bash
cd packages/lssvm-contracts

# Load environment variables
source .env.local

# Deploy all contracts
forge script script/DeployForBase.s.sol:DeployForBase \
  --rpc-url $RPC_URL \
  --broadcast \
  --verify \
  --sender $(cast wallet address $PRIVATE_KEY) \
  -vvvv
```

The script will:
1. Deploy RoyaltyEngine
2. Deploy all 4 pair templates (ERC721ETH, ERC721ERC20, ERC1155ETH, ERC1155ERC20)
3. Deploy LSSVMPairFactory
4. Deploy VeryFastRouter
5. Automatically whitelist sudoswap's bonding curves (if deployer is factory owner)
6. Automatically whitelist the router (if deployer is factory owner)

## Step 3: Verify Deployment

After deployment, the script will print a summary with all contract addresses. Save these addresses!

Verify the factory was deployed correctly:

```bash
# Replace FACTORY_ADDRESS with the actual address from deployment
FACTORY_ADDRESS=0x...

cast call $FACTORY_ADDRESS "owner()" --rpc-url $RPC_URL
cast call $FACTORY_ADDRESS "protocolFeeRecipient()" --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

Verify bonding curves are whitelisted:

```bash
# Sudoswap bonding curve addresses (Ethereum Mainnet - stateless, reused on Base)
LINEAR_CURVE=0xe5d78fec1a7f42d2F3620238C498F088A866FdC5
EXPONENTIAL_CURVE=0xfa056C602aD0C0C4EE4385b3233f2Cb06730334a
XYK_CURVE=0xc7fB91B6cd3C67E02EC08013CEBb29b1241f3De5
GDA_CURVE=0x1fD5876d4A3860Eb0159055a3b7Cb79fdFFf6B67

cast call $FACTORY_ADDRESS "bondingCurveAllowed(address)" $LINEAR_CURVE --rpc-url $RPC_URL
cast call $FACTORY_ADDRESS "bondingCurveAllowed(address)" $EXPONENTIAL_CURVE --rpc-url $RPC_URL
cast call $FACTORY_ADDRESS "bondingCurveAllowed(address)" $XYK_CURVE --rpc-url $RPC_URL
cast call $FACTORY_ADDRESS "bondingCurveAllowed(address)" $GDA_CURVE --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

Verify router is whitelisted:

```bash
# Replace ROUTER_ADDRESS with the actual address from deployment
ROUTER_ADDRESS=0x...

cast call $FACTORY_ADDRESS "routerStatus(address)" $ROUTER_ADDRESS --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

## Step 4: Manual Configuration (If Needed)

If the deployer is not the factory owner, you'll need to manually whitelist the bonding curves and router:

```bash
# Set your addresses
FACTORY_ADDRESS=0x...
ROUTER_ADDRESS=0x...
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key

# Whitelist bonding curves
cast send $FACTORY_ADDRESS \
  "setBondingCurveAllowed(address,bool)" \
  0xe5d78fec1a7f42d2F3620238C498F088A866FdC5 true \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
  --rpc-url $RPC_URL

cast send $FACTORY_ADDRESS \
  "setBondingCurveAllowed(address,bool)" \
  0xfa056C602aD0C0C4EE4385b3233f2Cb06730334a true \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
  --rpc-url $RPC_URL

cast send $FACTORY_ADDRESS \
  "setBondingCurveAllowed(address,bool)" \
  0xc7fB91B6cd3C67E02EC08013CEBb29b1241f3De5 true \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
  --rpc-url $RPC_URL

cast send $FACTORY_ADDRESS \
  "setBondingCurveAllowed(address,bool)" \
  0x1fD5876d4A3860Eb0159055a3b7Cb79fdFFf6B67 true \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
  --rpc-url $RPC_URL

# Whitelist router
cast send $FACTORY_ADDRESS \
  "setRouterAllowed(address,bool)" \
  $ROUTER_ADDRESS true \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
  --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

## Step 5: Update Miniapp Configuration

After deployment, update `apps/miniapp/.env.local` with your deployed addresses:

```bash
# Base Mainnet (chainId: 8453)
NEXT_PUBLIC_FACTORY_ADDRESS_8453=0xYourFactoryAddress
NEXT_PUBLIC_ROUTER_ADDRESS_8453=0xYourRouterAddress

# RPC Configuration (if not already set)
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.base.org
# Or use your own RPC endpoint:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_RPC_URL=https://base-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_API_KEY

# IPFS Configuration (optional)
NEXT_PUBLIC_IPFS_URL=https://ipfs.io
```

**Important**: Restart your Next.js dev server after updating `.env.local` for changes to take effect.

## Step 6: Test the Deployment

1. **Create a test pool**: Use the factory to create a test ERC721 pool
2. **Verify pool appears**: Check that the pool appears in the browse page at `/browse/[nftContractAddress]`
3. **Test buying**: Try buying an NFT from the pool
4. **Test selling**: Try selling an NFT to the pool

## Troubleshooting

### "Bonding curve not whitelisted" error
- Make sure you've whitelisted all 4 sudoswap bonding curves
- Verify the addresses are correct (they're Ethereum Mainnet addresses, but stateless)

### "Router not whitelisted" error
- Make sure you've whitelisted your router address in the factory
- Verify the router address is correct

### Factory owner mismatch
- If auto-configuration was skipped, manually configure using Step 4
- Make sure you're using the factory owner's private key

### Contracts not verified on BaseScan
- Make sure `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` is set correctly
- BaseScan uses the same API as Etherscan
- You can verify manually later if needed

## Notes

- **Bonding curves are stateless**: The sudoswap bonding curves deployed on Ethereum Mainnet can be reused on Base because they have no state. They're pure calculation contracts.
- **Fee collection**: Your factory will collect protocol fees according to `PROTOCOL_FEE_MULTIPLIER` and send them to `PROTOCOL_FEE_RECIPIENT`.
- **Factory ownership**: The `FACTORY_OWNER` address has full control over the factory, including fee updates and whitelisting.

## Next Steps

After deployment:
1. Update the miniapp environment variables
2. Test pool creation and trading
3. Monitor fee collection
4. Consider setting up a subgraph for better pool discovery performance (see `FUTURE_INDEXING.md`)
